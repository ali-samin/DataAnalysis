# Google Play Store EDA and Feature Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Google Play Store dataset. The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover insights and prepare it for machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of data from the Google Play Store, which includes information about various apps. The dataset typically includes columns such as:
- `App`: Name of the app
- `Category`: Category of the app
- `Rating`: Rating of the app
- `Reviews`: Number of reviews
- `Size`: Size of the app
- `Installs`: Number of installs
- `Type`: Paid or Free
- `Price`: Price of the app
- `Content Rating`: Age group for the app
- `Genres`: Genres associated with the app
- `Last Updated`: Date of last update
- `Current Ver`: Current version of the app
- `Android Ver`: Required Android version

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and removing inconsistencies.
- **Size Conversion:** Converting app sizes from various units (MB, KB) into a uniform unit (KB).
- **Installs Conversion:** Converting install counts from text to integer values.
- **Price Conversion:** Converting price values from text to numeric values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identifying trends, popular categories, and notable metrics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on existing data, such as app age and rating categories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-play-store-eda-feature-engineering.git
   cd google-play-store-eda-feature-engineering
   ```

2. **Place the dataset file in the repository directory** (e.g., `googleplaystore.csv`).

3. **Run the EDA and feature engineering script:**

   ```bash
   python eda_feature_engineering.py
   ```

4. **View results** in the generated outputs and plots.

### Scripts

- `eda_feature_engineering.py`: Main script for data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA.

### Example Analysis

- **Most Popular Category:** Identify which category has the highest number of installs.
- **Most Installed App:** Find the app with the highest number of installs.
- **Largest Size App:** Determine the app with the largest size.
