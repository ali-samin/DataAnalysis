# Flight Price Prediction

This repository contains a project on predicting flight prices using a dataset of flight details. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Before EDA and Feature Engineering:**
  - `Airline`: The airline operating the flight
  - `Date_of_Journey`: Date of the journey
  - `Source`: Source city
  - `Destination`: Destination city
  - `Route`: Flight route
  - `Dep_Time`: Departure time
  - `Arrival_Time`: Arrival time
  - `Duration`: Duration of the flight
  - `Total_Stops`: Number of stops
  - `Additional_Info`: Additional information
  - `Price`: Price of the flight

- **After EDA and Feature Engineering:**
  - `Total_Stops`: Number of stops
  - `Additional_Info`: Additional information
  - `Price`: Price of the flight
  - `Date`: Extracted date from `Date_of_Journey`
  - `Month`: Extracted month from `Date_of_Journey`
  - `Year`: Extracted year from `Date_of_Journey`
  - `Arrival_hour`: Hour of arrival
  - `Arrival_minutes`: Minutes of arrival
  - `Dep_hour`: Hour of departure
  - `Dep_minutes`: Minutes of departure
  - `Duration_hour`: Duration in hours
  - `Duration_minute`: Duration in minutes
  - **One Hot Encoded Columns:**
    - `Airline_Air Asia`
    - `Airline_Air India`
    - `Airline_GoAir`
    - `Airline_IndiGo`
    - `Airline_Jet Airways`
    - `Airline_Jet Airways Business`
    - `Airline_Multiple carriers`
    - `Airline_Multiple carriers Premium economy`
    - `Airline_SpiceJet`
    - `Airline_Trujet`
    - `Airline_Vistara`
    - `Airline_Vistara Premium economy`
    - `Source_Banglore`
    - `Source_Chennai`
    - `Source_Delhi`
    - `Source_Kolkata`
    - `Source_Mumbai`
    - `Destination_Banglore`
    - `Destination_Cochin`
    - `Destination_Delhi`
    - `Destination_Hyderabad`
    - `Destination_Kolkata`
    - `Destination_New Delhi`

## Techniques Used

- **One Hot Encoding:** Applied to categorical features such as `Airline`, `Source`, and `Destination` to convert them into numerical format.
- **Label Encoding:** Used for features with ordinal values (if applicable).

## Notes

- The data has been transformed to include more detailed temporal features such as hours and minutes of departure and arrival.
- One Hot Encoding has created new columns for each unique category in the categorical features.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

You can use the preprocessed data for modeling and analysis. The notebook includes all steps for EDA and feature engineering.
